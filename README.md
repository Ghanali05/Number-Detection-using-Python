Handwritten digit recognition is a classic computer vision problem that has numerous real-world applications, from postal mail sorting to digitizing handwritten documents. In this project, I built and trained a CNN model using the MNIST dataset (or a custom dataset) to recognize digits (0-9) from handwritten images.
